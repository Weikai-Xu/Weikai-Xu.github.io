<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm currently a PhD student in the School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, under the supervision of [Prof. Ru Huang](https://ic.pku.edu.cn/szdw/ysfc/hr/33636f0f07244a1e919731dface7f190.htm). I am also privileged to be advised by [Prof. Qianqian Huang](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/qianqianhuang/jianjie) and [Prof. Meng Li](https://mengli.me/). My research interests lie on emerging device-based memories, in-memory computing and searching circuits and architectures, and algorithm-hardware co-design for AI acceleration.
